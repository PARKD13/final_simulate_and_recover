I ran into problems with vs studio recognizing my files. So unless they are all in the same directory the code would not run. Previously things had run when my code was generally incomplete. However, at some point the code stopped seeing my src module and the test module was unable to interact with the src file. I was troubleshooting for a long time and even created a new repository to see if it would refersh. However, I was unable to figure out the problems. Nevertheless, my code should work and be correct there is only a problem with the modules not being recognized. I have the __init__.py files in both modules and they show up in my directory so I don't understand why it is not working. Please bear with me.
